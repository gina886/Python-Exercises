🎮How to Use This Repository 🎮
 1. Pick a topic and difficulty
Choose what you want to practice (Pandas, NumPy, etc.) and your level (basic, intermediate, advanced).

 2. Run the exercises
Most are Python scripts (.py) or Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb). Run scripts normally or jump into notebooks for hands-on fun.

 3. Explore and experiment
Each exercise has comments to guide you. Don’t be shy — tweak the code, break it, fix it, and learn!

  4. Try the projects
When you’re ready, tackle mini-projects in the projects/ folder that combine your skills in real-world-like challenges.
